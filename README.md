#  Directus 7 — Extensions 
Hi! I’m Shea, feel free to use these extensions for whatever you need!

[Directus 7](https://github.com/directus) is a Headless CMS, it's built so that it can be extended easily. All extensions that I build for Directus, will be made open-source here. 

Every extension will have it's own directory, to "install" these extensions, add the contents of the extension directory to the `/extensions/custom` directory inside your Directus API.
